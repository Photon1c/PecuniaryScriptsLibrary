## 🧭 How to Time It Quantitatively

| **Metric** | **Description** | **Signal the Treadmill Is Slowing** |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| **Total Dealer Gamma Exposure (GEX)** | Net gamma sum from option chains. | Trending toward 0 or positive → dealers long gamma (stable). |
| **Gamma per 1 % Move** | Sensitivity measure (shown in your charts). | < 0.5 = slow treadmill; > 1 = fast treadmill. |
| **Implied Volatility vs. Historic Vol** | Tension between perceived and realized movement. | IV ≈ HV → hedging equilibrium (belt stabilizing). |
| **Put/Call Sell Ratio** | Shows balance of short-gamma positions. | 1 : 1 or lower = equilibrium; higher = stress. |
| **Distance from Max Pain** | How far price is from dealer comfort zone. | Within ± 0.5 % → minimal hedge churn. |
