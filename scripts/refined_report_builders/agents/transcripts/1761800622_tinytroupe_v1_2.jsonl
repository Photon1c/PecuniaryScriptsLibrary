Identify whether there is a bullish or bearish trend based on closing prices from the previous week.\n\n2. **Volatility Regimes**: Assess the implied volatility (IV) levels and historical volatility (HV) to determine if the market is in a high or low volatility regime. This can influence dealer gamma exposure.\n\n3. **Support/Resistance Levels**: Identify key support and resistance levels based on historical price action. These levels can serve as potential pivot points for price movements on Monday.\n\n4. **Anomalies**: Look for any unusual volume spikes or price movements in the options market that may indicate dealer positioning or sentiment shifts.\n\n### Testable Hypotheses:\n\n1. **Hypothesis 1**: If SPY opens above a defined resistance level on Monday, then the likelihood of continued upward momentum increases, supported by positive dealer gamma exposure.\n\n2. **Hypothesis 2**: If implied volatility is significantly higher than historical volatility at the Monday open, then there may be an increased probability of a reversal in price direction, indicating a potential mean reversion scenario.\n\nThese hypotheses can be tested using historical data to validate their predictive power."}}
