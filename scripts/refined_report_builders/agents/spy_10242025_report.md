## 📊 Chart Analysis Summary

### Alex Rivera (Gamma Exposure):
> “The gamma flip at 671.80 is a critical pivot — we’re just above it, meaning market makers are net short gamma and will be hedging by buying on dips. The call wall at 680 and put wall at 660 suggest strong resistance and support zones. With last price at 677.25, we’re in a gamma squeeze zone — any move above 680 could trigger aggressive short covering.”

### Jordan Chen (Max Pain & Skew):
> “Max pain sits at 670 — that’s where option sellers want the market to land. But the skew chart shows a pronounced upward slope, signaling bullish sentiment. That’s conflicting with max pain theory. I think the market will trade *above* max pain next week — likely testing 680–685 as the skew implies upside bias.”

### Taylor Morgan (Premium / Volume Profile):
> “Volume profile shows heavy concentration between 675–680. The IV is elevated at 13.42%, but premium sold is higher on calls (33%) vs puts (24%), suggesting institutional call writing. The 3.7% skew confirms bulls are paying up for upside protection. I expect consolidation near 678–682 before a breakout.”

### Casey Dubois (Risk Manager):
> “With $200 per trader, we can’t afford large directional bets. I recommend using vertical spreads or iron condors around key levels. Focus on defined risk, high probability setups. Avoid naked positions. We need to preserve capital while capturing volatility.”

## 💡 Consensus Outlook

All traders agree:
- **Support**: 670–672 (max pain + gamma flip)
- **Resistance**: 680–685 (call wall + volume cluster)
- **Bias**: Slightly bullish due to skew and gamma structure
- **Volatility**: Elevated but manageable; ideal for credit spreads or ratio plays

## 📌 Key Risks & Notes

- **Fed Speeches / Earnings**: Potential catalysts mid-week.
- **Gamma Flip Reversion**: If SPY drops below 671.80, gamma hedging flips to selling pressure.
- **IV Crush**: After Friday close, implied volatility may drop sharply — avoid long options into expiration.

✅ **Final Verdict**: Bullish bias with defined risk. Target range for SPY next week: **672–685**. Best entry points near 675–677 for longs, 680–682 for shorts.
