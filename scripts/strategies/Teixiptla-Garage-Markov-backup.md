Fading IV is selling insurance when people are scared but safe; deploying convexity is buying insurance when people are calm but wrong.

### Core Principle

Fading IV is a mean-reversion trade.  
Convexity is a regime-change trade.

## The Four Volatility Regimes (This is the Key Table)

| IV Rank | IV Percentile | Meaning                                  | Bias                |
|---------|---------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Low     | Low           | Vol is cheap and rarely this low         | Convexity favored   |
| High    | High          | Vol is expensive and often fades         | Fade favored        |
| High    | Low           | One-off spike                            | Be careful fading   |
| Low     | High          | Persistent low-vol regime                | Convexity delayed   |

### Fading IV is Safer When:
- IV Rank is high → you’re near historical extremes
- IV Percentile is high → this happens often enough to fade
- IV slope is flat or falling → market already supplying vol

*That’s the holy trinity for short vol.*

### Convexity is Justified When:
- IV Rank is low → vol is cheap
- IV Percentile is low → market is complacent
- IV slope turns positive → repricing has started

*This is where small premium buys can pay multiples.*

# The “Anatomy” of the Profitable Trade, in 5 Teixiptla Steps

**Step 1 — Diagnose the ceremony (state)**  
You label the market moment, e.g.:  
- Pin / Chop: blanket tight, walls respected  
- Pre-transfer: pressure building near flip/wall  
- Transfer / Tear: boundary breaks; repricing; volatility regime change  

This is Markov blanket logic: what’s inside vs outside matters.

**Step 2 — Choose the correct skin for the ceremony (structure)**  
Different ceremonies demand different skins:  
- Pin: sell rich skin (short premium, defined risk)  
- Transfer: buy convex skin (debit spreads, long options)  
- Pre-transfer: probes, calendars, tight spreads  

This is the “structure” axis.

**Step 3 — Measure mispricing (cheap ask / expensive bid)**  
This is the heart of the “profitable anatomy.”  

A trade is “cheap entry ask” when at least one is true:  
- IV is low vs realized / expected future variance  
- Skew/term are misaligned with your scenario  
- Bid/ask is favorable (liquidity present)  
- You’re buying convexity when the market is pricing stasis  

A trade is “expensive exit bid” when:  
- IV has expanded (if you were long)  
- IV has crushed (if you were short)  
- Spot moved into the region that forces dealer hedging (walls/flip)  
- Spread/market depth improves at your exit point

**Step 4 — Kelly as the “Offering Gate” (permission sizing)**  
Here’s the key Teixiptla integration:  
Kelly should be computed conditional on the ceremony label:  
- If in Pin regime: Kelly is allowed to allocate to mean reversion structures.  
- If in Transfer regime: Kelly is allowed to allocate to convex structures.  
- If regime is uncertain: Kelly forces “PROBE” sizing.  

So Kelly isn’t one number. It’s:  

**Kelly(structure | regime | surface)**  

This is how it remains “within Teixiptla” rather than stapled onto it.

**Step 5 — The skin transfer (exit trigger)**  
Exit is literally: you sell the skin back when the crowd has re-priced it.  

Mechanically, you exit on:  
- Reaching a wall / flip interaction objective  
- IV move objective (crush/expansion captured)  
- Time decay becomes dominant vs remaining edge  
- Bid quality improves (you can actually get paid)

**The Logistics: Keep It Organized as a Diagram (no code yet)**  

To keep this from getting tangled again, adopt this anatomy table:  

**A) Ceremony Label (Teixiptla / Markov)**  
- pin / pre-transfer / transfer  

**B) Skin Selection (Garage structure)**  
- which structure fits that ceremony  

**C) Mispricing Test (cheap ask / expensive bid)**  
- IV level vs expected  
- skew shape  
- term shape  
- spread/liquidity  

**D) Kelly Gate (offering size)**  
- fraction = kelly(p,b) × mask_integrity × term_confidence × skew_risk  

**E) Transfer Rules (exit)**  
- where and why to transfer skin back  

---

**One Tight Story Example (so it “clicks”)**  

**Pin day near call wall, IV very low.**  
- Ceremony: mask stable (pin)  
- Skin: short premium but defined risk (iron condor / short call spread)  
- Cheap/expensive logic: you’re selling “overpriced calm” (premium rich relative to realized chops)  
- Kelly: allows moderate sizing only if pin metrics are stable and spreads are tight  
- Transfer: exit when spot re-pins and IV compresses further / time decay captured; sell-to-close at favorable bid  

**Transfer day crossing flip, skew steepening, IV term inverts.**  
- Ceremony: mask tearing (transfer)  
- Skin: long convexity (debit spreads / long options)  
- Cheap entry: options still priced for calm (IV lagging)  
- Kelly: shifts allocation away from short premium and into convex structures  
- Transfer: exit into IV expansion / wall chase when bids get fat

**The one sentence that keeps us aligned**  

Teixiptla tells you what ritual is happening; Kelly tells you how much blood to spill.
