# Option Modeling Predictive Parameters - Deep Seek Research Report 03.21.2025  
| **Feature**               | **Description**                                                                 | **Application in Predictive Algorithms**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Underlying Price (S)**   | Current price of the underlying asset (e.g., stock, index).                     | Core input for pricing models (e.g., Black-Scholes) and predicting directional trends.                   |
| **Strike Price (K)**       | Predefined price at which the option can be exercised.                          | Determines intrinsic value and influences hedging strategies.                                            |
| **Time to Expiry (T)**     | Time remaining until the option contract expires.                               | Critical for modeling time decay (theta) and volatility surface dynamics.                                |
| **Volatility (σ)**         | Historical or implied volatility of the underlying asset.                      | Predicts price swings; stochastic volatility models (e.g., Heston) use this for risk-neutral pricing.    |
| **Risk-Free Rate (r)**     | Interest rate for risk-free investments (e.g., Treasury bonds).                 | Discounts future cash flows in pricing models; impacts rho (sensitivity to interest rates).               |
| **Dividend Yield (q)**     | Expected dividends from the underlying asset during the option's life.          | Adjusts pricing models for dividend-paying assets (e.g., Merton model).                                  |
| **Implied Volatility (IV)**| Market-derived volatility inferred from option prices.                          | Gauges market sentiment; used to forecast volatility regimes or arbitrage opportunities.                 |
| **Moneyness (S/K)**        | Ratio of underlying price to strike price (ITM, ATM, OTM).                      | Classifies options for strategy optimization (e.g., skewness modeling).                                  |
| **Greeks (Δ, Γ, Θ, ν, ρ)**| Sensitivities of option price to factors like price (delta), time (theta), etc. | Hedging, portfolio optimization, and stress-testing predictive models under varying market conditions.    |
| **Volatility Smile/Skew**  | Implied volatility pattern across strikes.                                      | Identifies market anomalies; improves pricing models for extreme events (e.g., SABR model).              |
| **Open Interest/Volume**   | Trading activity and liquidity of the option contract.                          | Predicts short-term price movements and liquidity risk.                                                  |
| **Jump Diffusion**         | Parameters for sudden price jumps (e.g., jump intensity, magnitude).            | Models tail-risk events (e.g., Merton jump model) for crash-resistant algorithms.                        |
| **Correlation**            | Relationship between underlying asset and other variables (e.g., indices).      | Multi-asset strategies (e.g., dispersion trading) and basket option pricing.                             |
| **Early Exercise Premium** | Additional value for American-style options due to early exercise.              | Tree-based models (e.g., Binomial/Trinomial) for pricing early-exercise decisions.                       |
