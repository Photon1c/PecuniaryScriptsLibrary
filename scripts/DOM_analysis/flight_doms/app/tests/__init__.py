"""Tests for the `flight_doms` app wrapper.

These tests are intentionally small and focused on smoke-testing behavior
that matters for operational reliability, especially around DOM retrieval
and error handling.

They are written with Linux/VPS usage in mind first (inside `lobsterenv`),
but can be reused on Windows once a comparable environment is available.
