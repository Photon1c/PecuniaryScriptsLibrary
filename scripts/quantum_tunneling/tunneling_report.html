    <h3>ℹ️ About Quantum Tunneling Model</h3>
    <p style="margin:8px 0;line-height:1.6;color:#555;">
        This model calculates the probability of price "tunneling" through resistance/support barriers 
        based on option market microstructure. Higher probabilities indicate weaker barriers due to:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin:8px 0;line-height:1.8;color:#555;">
        <li><strong>Wide bid-ask spreads</strong> → less conviction at that strike</li>
        <li><strong>Low volume/open interest</strong> → thin order book</li>
        <li><strong>Order imbalance</strong> → directional pressure from calls vs puts</li>
        <li><strong>IV compression</strong> → market uncertainty reduced</li>
    </ul>
